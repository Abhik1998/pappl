Printers are managed by the system and are represented by the
[`pappl_printer_t`](#pappl_printer_t) type.  Each printer is connected to a
device and uses a driver to process document data and produce output.  PAPPL
supports raster printers out-of-the-box and provides filter callbacks to support
other kinds of printers.
